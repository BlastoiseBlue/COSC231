<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>My name is Emmet Stanevich. I was born in New York, and currently live in Ann Arbor, Michigan. For my entire life, I've lived in either New York or Michigan, having moved between the two states a couple times.</p>
<p>I am currently a sophomore at Eastern Michigan University. My major is in Computer Science. I am currently taking COSC 231. I was also the lead driver of <a href="https://frc5708.org">Community High School's robotics team</a>, being with the team during its first 3 years.</p>
<h3>Interests and Hobbies:</h3>
<p>My main interest is in computers, specifically video games.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://playhearthstone.com">Hearthstone</a> is a game I tend to play in my free time, usually during the downtime between classes</li>
<li>Another game I have been playing is <a href="https://starcraft2.com">Starcraft 2</a>, after finishing a day of school</li>
<li>I have also played several entries from the "Mega Man X" franchise, via the Legacy Collection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dreams and Goals:</h3>
<p>My main dream is to become a video game developer, creating something that will bring entertainment to others. I have been a gemer for most of my life, and I wish to create something of my own for others to enjoy, just as I have enjoyed the works of others. I have already taken 2 summer camps in game modding a few years back.</p>
<p>As the former lead driver of my High School robotics team, I have also become very interested in robots. As a result of this, I also aspire to learn more about robotics in general, both in terms of programming and physical mechanisms. While It has been a couple years since I was on the team, the experiences of driving the team's robot inspires me to learn more about robotics.</p>
