<td class="sixtySix"><p>My main dream is to become a video game developer, creating something that will bring entertainment to others. I have been a gemer for most of my life, and I wish to create something of my own for others to enjoy, just as I have enjoyed the works of others. I have already taken 2 summer camps in game modding a few years back.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="sixtySix"><p>As the former lead driver of my High School robotics team, I have also become very interested in robots. As a result of this, I also aspire to learn more about robotics in general, both in terms of programming and physical mechanisms. While It has been a couple years since I was on the team, the experiences of driving the team's robot inspires me to learn more about robotics.</p></td></tr>
